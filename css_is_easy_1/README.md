## Task
The problem was to create a responsive HTML webpage using CSS flexbox that can handle both mobile and desktop views. The challenge was to arrange the different sections of the webpage, namely the header, hero, content, sidebar, and footer, in a particular order, and style each section with a unique background color.
## Description
I have solved the problem by using CSS flexbox properties to arrange the different sections of the webpage. I have used media queries to define specific CSS styles for different screen sizes. For mobile view, I have arranged the sections in a column, and for desktop view, I have arranged them in a row.

To style each section with a unique background color, I have used CSS background-color property for each section.

## Installation
There was no installation necessary for this project

## Usage
The webpage uses HTML tags such as div to create different sections such as header, hero, content, sidebar, and footer. CSS flexbox properties are used to arrange these sections in a particular order, and media queries are used to define specific CSS styles for different screen sizes.

In mobile view, the sections are arranged in a column, while in desktop view, they are arranged in a row. Each section is styled with a unique background color using the background-color property.

The final result is a responsive webpage that can adapt to different screen sizes and arrange the different sections in a particular order with a unique background color for each section.
