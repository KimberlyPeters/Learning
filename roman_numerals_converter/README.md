***

## Task

The problem is to convert decimal numbers into Roman numerals. Roman numerals are a numeral system used in ancient Rome, where numbers are represented using letters such as I, V, X, L, C, D, and M. The challenge lies in mapping the decimal numbers to their corresponding Roman numeral representation.

## Description

The solution provides a set of functions that handle the conversion process. The main function, my_roman_numerals_converter, takes a decimal number as input and returns its equivalent Roman numeral representation.

To solve the problem, the code implements separate functions for converting units, tens, hundreds, and thousands. These functions handle different ranges of decimal numbers and build the Roman numeral representation accordingly. The conversion process follows the rules and patterns of the Roman numeral system.

## Installation
